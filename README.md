# Hex Minesweeper

This is a small pet project to practice with Rust and bevy. The idia is to create a hex variant of the well-known [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), that would be playable online.

at your option.
This means you can select the license you prefer!
This dual-licensing approach is the de-facto standard in the Rust ecosystem and there are [very good reasons](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/2373) to include both.
